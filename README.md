Shows you all possible modifiers you can roll/craft on vault gear at any level.  
In-game version of the [gear page](https://vault-hunters.netlify.app/gear), you don't have to leave the game now to see what you can modifiers you can get.  
Triangles with the same color indicate modifier exclusivity (you can't roll 2 modifiers with the same color).  

You can open the screen by pressing the "Gear Modifiers" button in the Vault Screen (right below the quest button) or by pressing dedicated keybind (unbound by default).  
You can disable or move the button in the config.
